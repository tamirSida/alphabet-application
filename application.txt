Feedback you need to address:
This looks great. My one comment is on the questions 13-17 about an idea - I think we need to make it clear this is not a prerequisite to the program. Some folks will want to be able to say they have no idea but want to learn about how to come up with an idea and that's great. Perhaps we preempt that section with a question asking them whether they have a business or idea in mind they would like to work on.
